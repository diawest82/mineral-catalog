# mineral-catalog

As part of your job, you’ve been asked to build a website that displays information about various minerals (AKA rocks). The home page of the site contains a list of all of the minerals in a database. Clicking on a mineral’s name opens a page that displays information about the mineral.

A web designer has already designed the pages. You only need to write the code to created the pages as they’ve been designed. Use the included HTML/CSS files to see how to structure and style the pages. You don’t need to alter global.css - just use it as is.
