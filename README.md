# mineral-catalog

As part of your job, you’ve been asked to build a website that displays information about various minerals (AKA rocks). The home page of the site contains a list of all of the minerals in a database. Clicking on a mineral’s name opens a page that displays information about the mineral.

A web designer has already designed the pages. You only need to write the code to created the pages as they’ve been designed. Use the included HTML/CSS files to see how to structure and style the pages. You don’t need to alter global.css - just use it as is.

After installing the required packages, you'll need to run a couple of things to launch it.
  Make the migrations to create the database and load in the settings
  load the static files with manage.py collectstatic
  load the data with manage.py load_data
  after you run it on your local machine everything should be working.
